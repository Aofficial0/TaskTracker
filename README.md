# Agile Development

## Overview

I used GitHub projects to develop my site.

<img src="core/static/images/user stories.png" alt="Responsive design" width="520">

## User Stories

My user stories encompassed all the essential features that I believed would deliver the most value to the user. I prioritized a focused, streamlined approach by adhering to agile principles and concentrating on developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This strategy allows for a strong foundation that can be iteratively enhanced and expanded over time, ensuring that future updates continue to meet user needs while maintaining a manageable scope.

#### Jigsaw and HTML Validation and CI Python Linter

- I used the W3 HTML Validator to check the HTML on each of my site pages by Direct Input. I have resolved the necessary errors.
- I used the W3 CSS Validator to check my CSS script by Direct Input. I found no errors!

<img src="core/static/images/css test.png" alt="python check" width="520">

- I used the CI Python Linter to check all my python scripts. I found a few small errors like the below - mostly lines were too long or there was a missing blank space line. I have left some of the error messages as they are related to a too long line at the result of a comment.

#### Deployment

- Repository created in Git

  A Git repository was created to track the project's code and changes, ensuring efficient version control and a history of all modifications.

- Deployed to Heroku

  The application was deployed to Heroku, a cloud platform, allowing it to be accessible online with managed infrastructure.

- Connected Secret Keys to config vars

  Sensitive information, such as secret keys, was securely managed (config vars), ensuring they remain separate from the codebase.

- Connected Code Institute PostGres Database

  The application is connected to a PostgreSQL database provided by Code Institute to manage and store data securely.
